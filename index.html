                 <p>Tariel é um projeto de narração que tem como objetivo juntar várias lores existentes e criar novas do zero. O projeto tem grande referência ao projeto <a href="http://www.originworlds.com/third-era" target="_blank">Third Era</a> de Daniel-André Sørensen (vulgo <a href="http://levodoom.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">Levodoom</a>), toda a arte cartográfica é creditada à ele, assim como a lore do sistema de magia.</p>
                 <p>A estória do mundo sera desenvolvida através de arcos curtos, aventuras de desenvolvimento rápido, podendo ou não estarem interligadas, de modo que seus backgrounds podem estar relacionados a algo maior, formando assim uma campanha.</p>
                 <p>Os arcos serão mestrados para grupos de 4-5 jogadores e terá inicio no começo de 2017. Além dos arcos será mestrado aventuras solos, onde haverá um desenvolvimento interpessoal de cada personagem dos jogadores.</p>
                 <p>Os jogadores irão ajudar na construção da lore através de escolhas que podem interferir diretamente com o futuro do mundo, em escopo regional e até mesmo global.</p>
                 <p>Atenção: o mundo não se nivela ao nivel dos jogadores. Além de vencer as batalhas, os jogadores terão que evitá-las.

                   <p>Segue abaixo os parametros da mesa em grupo (4-5 jogadores): </p>

                      <p>The Laws of Magic are a gathering of currently eighteen rules that pertain to the commonly accepted understandings of magic, in the respects of what it is, how it works, and the basic science of its existence. While not all mages will agree on these theories and supposed facts, a majority do, and thus the Laws are taught unanimously by most mage academies and schools. The Laws of Magic are constantly in a state of change, as new discoveries and revelations are found through the constant and seemingly endless study of the subject.<p>

                        <p>The original laws were first written by mages from the Convocation in Caldum, but have, over time, had more rules integrated, corrected and discovered from various other mage orders throughout the remaining world.</p>

                          <h4>Essentiality</h4>
                          <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                          <p>Magic is an essential power. It is required that magic exists to ensure the balance, sustainability and functionality of the world and the universe persists. It is only a one-way dependability since magic does not require the world to thrive or exist itself. Though be it as it may, magic does benefit in its growth from influencing worlds and the universe.</p>

                          <h4>Omnipresence</h4>
                          <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                          <p>Magic is everywhere. It surrounds all beings in life-energy (mana) and is part of all beings. Anyone can wield magic because there is always some magic within any living being, but some possess more life-energy than others, thus giving them greater aptitude over magic. Only a few in a hundred can truly control and use magic in conjunction with magical handlings that involve, for instance, spells.</p>

                          <h4>Danger</h4>
                          <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                          <p>Magic is a dangerous power. It holds the power to corrupt, weaken and kill, and its use depends on the life-energy (mana) of the world or living beings. When wielding magic, there is great risk for not only the world and other people, but for the wielder as well.</p>

                          <h4>Potential</h4>
                          <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                          <p>Magic is a potential power. It holds the power to heal, enhance and support in acts of rejuvenation, health and general progress. When controlled properly with the right mind to supervise its effects, magic can be used to mend the world and its inhabitants. Magic can potentially be used to do anything, though this also includes causing extreme harm and imbalance.</p>

                          <h4>Instability</h4>
                          <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                          <p>Magic is a wild power. It is a power that will grow and lash out unless controlled effectively. There is no absolute certainty that magic will act the way one wishes it to do, but the process can be altered through control and understanding to grant a more accurate result when releasing the magical energy.</p>

                          <h4>Persistence</h4>
                          <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                          <p>Magic is a persistent power. It cannot dissipate entirely, but can grow weaker in its presence. It will remain and shift around the world to where it is most likely to thrive under better conditions.</p>

                          <h4>Independence</h4>
                          <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                          <p>Magic is an independent power. It requires no aid from outside forces to exist, as it is fully capable of sustaining itself by its own. If the world, its people, the deities and the universe was to cease existence, magic would remain and slowly rebuild the universe by itself.</p>

                          <h4>Infinity</h4>
                          <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                          <p>Magic is an infinite power. It is never-ending in its quantities. It slowly grows by itself and loses very little of its overall power. When reaching limits, it releases magical energy to avoid extreme density; effectively weakening itself to prevent extensive growth.</p>

                          <h4>Origins</h4>
                          <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                          <p>Magic has three sources; Natural, Deistic and Arcane. Natural draws power from the life-energy of the world, spirits and living beings. Deistic draws power from deities and any similar beings. Arcane draws power from the planes and the universe itself. All three sources intertwine with each other, and magic must be refined through a source to become usable.</p>

                          <h4>Neutrality</h4>
                          <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                          <p>Magic is a neutral power. It is neither from the source of good nor evil, but rather acts on the will of those who wield it. Magic does not act on its own morality-based will. It only responds to those who wield it and the world and universe’s needs. As such magic is more or less a natural force.</p>

                         <h4>Equivalent Exchange</h4>
                         <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                         <p>Magic requires equivalent exchange. The wielder must give his or her life-energy (mana) to effectively use magic. In all things pertaining to magic, magic will require some exchange in power or energy to maintain the Law of Infinity and the Law of Essentiality.</p>

                         <h4>Reversiblity</h4>
                         <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                         <p>Magic is a reversible power. Anything caused by magic can be undone by magic. The magical energies that persist in the world and the universe will always react to each other, but it mainly depends on how these energies meet and the conditions they are surrounded by. Generally a stronger force of magic will neutralize a weaker force of magic.</p>

                         <h4>Immaterialness</h4>
                         <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                         <p>Magic is an immaterial power. It cannot be materialized in any way to create new forever-lasting components or materials, nor can it reshape or otherwise physically alter existing materials' natural components. It can, however, be bent and shaped into controlled magical energy; either from life-energy (mana) or surrounding magical energies to create, for example, frost-bolts or fireballs, or even temporary weapons or armour.</p>

                         <h4>Association</h4>
                         <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                         <p>Magic is an associative power. Any relation between an item and a being’s magical energies strengthen the association between the two; allowing for a strong connection that can cause improved effects through spells or passive magic. By associating, say, an item such as a ring or piece of clothing to a specific person, the magic cast will be more potent and more successful to succeed in favourable results. This is a vague law and does not always work properly.</p>

                         <h4>Understanding</h4>
                         <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                         <p>Magic is a controllable power. A wielder’s knowledge and understanding of magic in how its effects may cause various results can, and most likely will, allow the wielder better control over the magical energies he possesses. By understanding the basics of magic’s specific and overall effect through a spell, the magical energies are far more willing for use to the point where the energies are well within desired control by the wielder.</p>

                         <h4>Integration</h4>
                         <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                         <p>Magic is an integrative power. It is possible to focus enough magical energy to effectively imbue an item with desired effects. If done properly, the magical energies integrated into an object will remain within it until the object itself is either broken or completely destroyed. These objects must also be properly attuned or strengthened vessels to be able to carry the desired amount of magical energies. The process of imbuing objects with magic is commonly known as enchanting, and requires substantial control and knowledge to ensure as little magical repercussion as possible.</p>

                         <h4>Uncertainty</h4>
                         <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                         <p>Magic is an uncertain power. All current understanding of magic is to be taken with some uncertainty, as magic, in all its power and existence, holds the action and, ironically, the near certainty to not stay true to the given and currently written laws of magic. As such magic must be studied and understood, so that its secrets unravel for the good of knowledge and magical progress.</p>

                         <h4>Repercussion</h4>
                         <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                         <p>Magic is a power of backlash. If a mage should completely lose control over the magical energies he or she has built up over their lifetime, the risk of implosion by magic reaches imminent probability. The greater the magical energy, the bigger the backlash. In other words; when a mage dies, he or she relinquishes their energies and are consumed by the magic they held. Thus a mage, upon death, will disintegrate into ashes and the magical energies will return to the world. There is usually little damage caused to anyone else near the deceasing mage. Death and Spiritism are the only magical schools that has been able to defy the Law of Repercussion.</p>

                      <p>While there are certainly many various schools and arts of magic in the world of Tariel, these sixteen are the most prominent and most common ones practiced by mages, priests, cultists and more alike. These various magical arts may not hold the same name across the entire world, but the basic principle of their individual practices and uses remain mostly the same. Additionally, there are many variants and off-shoots of these magical arts, and there are those that are similar yet unique to themselves. Some of these schools are considered too dangerous in several nations and circles, effectively making them illegal to practice or just simply frowned upon.<p>

                        <p>Mages throughout the world spend entire lives to harness the power of the magical arts, or simply study them as a means to further gain knowledge and understanding of both magic and the world itself. It is common for mages to undertake one or two schools of magic to focus their magical energies on the schools' respective spells, as trying to understand all of them at the same time can be a task too difficult for a single mind. However, this does not stop a mage from trying, since mages across the entire world strive to learn as much about the various arts of magic as they possibly can. Typically spellcasters in general just tend to learn bits from various schools rather than trying to become masters of one school in particular.</p>

                             <p>Conjuration is the art of summoning or rematerializing certain beings or items. For example, a mage proficient in conjuration can summon creatures from other planes, establish portals or materialize the components of an item and reassemble it elsewhere. When summoning planar beings, a caster using Conjuration must firstly establish certain rules or laws that the summoned being cannot disobey. However, depending on the strength and power of the summoned creature, these rules can sometimes be broken, or the creature is able to find a loop-hole to free itself from the summoner’s control. Also, the longer a summoned being is being shackled, the more likely it is that it will be able to escape. As such the act of summoning is often taught to be extremely dangerous, and should not be practiced too often, if ever.</p>
                             <p>Conjuration can also be used in conjunction with magical energy to craft temporary magical armour or weapons. Such magical equipment dissipates depending on the amount of magical energy used, as well as on the caster’s ability to control said magical energy. Conjurers also use this school to dismantle and then dematerialize any nourishing residue that hangs in the air; effectively creating food or liquids that, while not as nourishing or tasteful as the real deal, can be consumed to replenish small amounts of energy. </p>
                             <p>The general act of materialization allows a conjurer to create temporary, magically infused phenomenon such as rain and fog; depending very much on what available residues that circulate in the surrounding air. Typically Conjuration is most effective in areas strong with magical energy, and will become less effective as the magical energies in that area are dissipated.</p>

                         <p>Illusionism is the art of bending the magical energies to create false imagery, hide objects or persons, and simply trick minds. Illusionism is a considerably basic school of magic, often considered weaker than the other schools in terms of power, since it can more or less cause very little physical harm. However, a skilled illusionist can easily create enough tricks and illusions to fool even the strongest minds, to the point where insanity in the victim can result as a factor, or even just manipulation to the point where the caster can willingly control another person to a limited degree. </p>
                         <p>Additionally, Illusionism is a school which requires very little actual magical knowledge, so even people who are not as gifted as mages in magical energy can learn to use it. Though it should be noted that mages are generally more likely to have greater understanding and control over the school. </p>
                         <p>Illusions can be anything from a simple, minor trick to creating entire realities that exist both within an individual’s mind and before an individual’s eyes. As such it is possible to trick a person’s senses to either mask the presence of pain, to cause confusion, or anything else similar that affects a person’s thoughts and feelings. Targets of Illusionism see, hear, touch, smell and/or taste things which do not actually exist, or they perceive things differently from what they truly are. Illusionism can allow a caster to manipulate several individuals at a time, and to mask not only himself and others in invisibility, but objects, rooms and, indeed, even larger objects or areas. Some illusionists can change their visual appearances. The greater the magical power of the caster, the stronger the illusions.</p>

                         <p>An inherently weak school which can’t cause physical damage, the power of an illusion depends on the power of the caster, stronger illusions require a lot of concentration</p>

                         <p>Life Magic is the art of mending wounds, revitalization and curing diseases. This is a popular school of magic and perhaps the one with the most positive effects. Healers are able to utilize the magical energies to heal even the most severe injuries, as well as remove fatal illnesses. Outside of conventional healing and medical aid, life magic can also be used to remove scars, regenerate life energy and even reverse aging to some degree, or at least mask age. Powerful wielders of life magic can potentially bring people back to life, as long as the soul of the recipient has yet to leave the vicinity of his or her body. </p>
                         <p>Life Magic draws no power from one source alone, as it can either come from nature, the arcane, the elemental or from deities. But depending on the source of energy, various Life spells can be cast and utilized. Life Magic can’t cause direct harm as it is solely devoted to revitalization of spirit and health. The only exception where Life Magic can deal damage is when it is cast upon beings of death or undeath, where the healing effects of a spell cause harm rather than rejuvenation or mending. </p>
                         <p>While a potent and life-saving school of magic, the chance of healing someone from fatal illnesses or mortal wounds largely depends on the caster’s own abilities. Small cuts and bruises are more easily mended, as are minor sicknesses such as sore throats and coughs. In fact, most ailments can be cured through Life Magic, including blindness and deafness. However, severed limbs cannot be reattached or regrown, as Life Magic mostly uses existing living tissue to cleanse and mend. Long dead tissue can’t be returned to life or revitalized, and as such Life Magic must be applied quickly to most injuries and ailments to ensure that the success and effectiveness of healing is more certain.</p>

                         <p>Shadow Magic is the art of utilizing the shadows for concealment, and sometimes illusions and summoning. Shadow magic holds the power to hide a person or object in shadows, often by drawing power from local sources rather than that of planar sources. Shadow magic is considered to be a dangerous school of magic because of its dark and negative effects on both beings and environments, and should see limited use due to the damage it can cause to the caster’s own body. Some wielders of this school use the shadows to shift their form into pure shadow, and also utilize shadow magic to teleport themselves for limited distances between existing shadows. </p>
                         <p>When a caster calls upon Shadow Magic, he draws energy from local sources rather than reach to another plane or beings. This basically means that a Shadow wielder can utilize any shadows in his vicinity to cast spells, merge with existing shadows or simply disappear into the darkness. As such Light Magic has proven to be an effective counter to this school, though a skilled and highly experienced Shadow wielder can overpower even Light itself. </p>
                         <p>Shadow Magic mainly focuses upon stealth and darkness, and only a few spells in its school have the actual capability to cause serious harm. Shadows, despite being a force of natural energy, can in excessive amounts disrupt the environment and corrupt it by robbing it of all of its light. Doing the same to a living body will have the same effect, unless that body is built purely on shadow energy. Beings of death and undeath are not quite so affected by Shadow Magic either. Additionally, Shadow Magic can be used to establish a connection with the Shadow Plane by creating a portal or summoning a being from that realm. It is, however, not recommended, since the caster would have little to no control over the summoned being.</p>

                         <p>Runology is the art of creating magical, written runes and glyphs infused with magical energy, and then inscribe these runes onto objects. This allows for a wide variety of different effects, such as creating explosive projectiles, laying runes on surfaces that activate at specific conditions, or runes temporarily or even permanently etched onto skin to enhance physical abilities. Runology can also be used to magically enhance items; most typically jewellery, armour or weaponry. This school is typically used by mage golem-makers or imp-makers, as it allows for a much simpler and effective way of creating and inscribing laws and abilities into artificially created beings.</p>
                         <p>Runology is easy to use and allows even individuals who are not mages or generally gifted with magic to craft magical runes, as runes are created by using magical ink, which itself is created through mixing magical components and ingredients. However, those who are gifted are more likely create runes that are controlled, efficient and more powerful, since they will use their own magical energies to further infuse the runes with less volatile magical energies.  </p>
                         <p>Those who study Runology, while it can be applied to create a large variety of effects on different objects, mostly use the school to write magical scrolls. Once a scroll is inscribed with magical runes, it is made possible for even non-gifted individuals to utilize these scrolls; allowing for activation through speech, which itself is triggered from the scroll's runes when imprinted words are spoken aloud. Runology is also a school which can be used to create new spells that can be shared with other spellcasters. This is why Runology is often considered to be a very lucrative and popular school, since even non-mages have a demand for magical scrolls, and spellmakers thrive happily on creating and copying spells that they sell to other mages.</p>

                         <p>Enchanting is the art of imbuing an object with magical properties. Jewellery, weapons or armour are the most typical objects subject to enchanting magic. Enchanting requires great concentration, skill and knowledge to result in favourable effects, and to avoid serious magical repercussions. Common enchantments range from harmful effects such as imbuing elemental or arcane damage into weapons, to adding enhancements to armour, rings etc. that improve a wearer’s physical or mental attributes. Enchantments are not necessarily limited to wearable equipment, and can also be applied to even mundane objects. Enchanting is also a school which is commonly used in creation of Golems, Imps and other constructs or familiars. </p>
                         <p>Certain materials, such as silver, react better to magical energies, thus granting better enchanted items. Enchanting is not necessarily a stable school, though it is more durable and more potent than Runology. Enchanted items will eventually lose their effects over time or through extensive use. But, depending on the ingredients or magical power used, the duration of the enchantment can be extended. Also noteworthy is the fact that once an object is enchanted, it can’t be enchanted again, thus only allowing for one or potentially two enchantments per object. </p>
                         <p>The typical process of enchanting an item involves using magical ingredients, which are then imbued into the item. Depending on the magical ingredients used, the effects can be very varied and potent. One doesn’t have to be gifted in magic to know enchanting, as there are devices and techniques that replicate the process fairly well. However, a person with extensive magical capabilities and skill can enchant items without having to use ingredients beforehand. This is how some enchanted items can be imbued with specific spells (such as shielding) instead of just giving them an effect. The actual results of using ingredients are limited when compared to someone who uses their own magical energy to enchant items.</p>

                         <p>Deitism (sometimes referred to as divine magic or holy magic) is the simple art of prayer to call upon favours from the gods themselves. This is a school of magic that holds a wide variety of different energies, depending on the deity that grants them; though the majority of energies are of Deistic origin. Deistic magic can only be called on through the power of deities, and thus the majority of those wielding deistic magic are priests, cultists or similar. Deistic magic can be used to cause holy damage, heal wounds or remove curses. Sometimes deistic magic can allow for resurrection, should the proper conditions be met, meaning that it largely depends on which deity the caster worships, or which deity the person being resurrected worships. </p>
                         <p>When a person devotes his or her life to a deity’s cause, it is likely that his or her prayers will be answered by that deity, and all of that deity’s willing powers will be available to that person. Depending on the deity, the methods of gaining favour is extremely varied. There are gods who powers to all their followers, and there are gods who restrict their gifts to only a select few individuals or sometimes even none. It is typically those who prove themselves worthy or those who are strongest in their faith who gain access to deistic magic. </p>
                         <p>Since Deitism is largely dependent on a deity being the source of its powers, it is not possible to teach this school of magic to the undevoted. The actual abilities of a worshiper depend on a mix of devotion and skill, meaning that the stronger one’s mind is, the more powerful the deistic magic becomes. Typical powers involve healing and smiting, and, depending on the deity, specialized powers will be available. Someone who devotedly serves the Divine will have powers infused with light and fire, whilst someone who serves Kelmora will have access to necromantic energies. The full range of powers are unknown, since new ones are granted every so often by the gods themselves, so that their worshipers might serve them better for their purposes.</p>

                         <p>Blood Magic is the art of stealing and altering life energy. It is a common school for directly causing pain and suffering to its victims, by means of sapping a person’s life to feed the wielder with it. Blood magic draws its powers from life and blood, either from the wielder or another person. This school of magic is typically very draining to one’s own energy, but in return it holds the potential to grant some extremely potent power. In some cases, blood magic is used to transform a victim’s blood into temporary beings of pure blood and magical energy; creatures mainly bound in service to the one who created them. Practitioners of blood magic are often in danger of demonic corruption, as blood magic tends to attract planar interest. </p>
                         <p>While Blood Magic is very powerful, it will rapidly drain a person of his or her own life energy and will begin to cause harm to one’s body. Most wielders of Blood Magic will avoid using their own life energy and instead use that of their enemies whenever possible. By doing this the caster can replenish his or her own life and magical energies by siphoning the strength away from his or her target. The presence of fresh blood empowers the abilities of Blood Magic, and so it is not unheard of that a caster will cut himself to increase the effectiveness and power of his or her spells, or, in more sinister circles, perform blood sacrifices to significantly empower rituals. </p>
                         <p>Blood Magic doesn’t necessarily only cause harm and suffering, as it can be used to revitalize a person’s life energy to some degree. Though in its overall core, Blood Magic is a school which focuses heavily on causing pain and death. Wielders of Blood Magic often become addicted to the suffering they perform on their victims, depending on their own willpower to resist its sating effects. The more powerful the spell or ritual, the more likely it is that demonic powers will be drawn to the caster. When demons appear it is often done intentionally as a means to shackle that demon to the caster’s will.</p>

                         <p>Arcanism is the art of controlling, as well as altering, the fabrics of the stars and universe itself, and utilizing the universal energies to materialize pure arcane energy. Arcane spells hold the potential to control time; though this is extremely difficult, and currently only possible a few seconds at a time. In a similar way, arcane magic can bend space to shift a caster or object’s position briefly. Arcane magic is dominantly used to gain better understanding of the universe and how it works, though it is fully possible to use pure arcane energy as a means to cause damage, and it can also be used to dispel magical energies for a limited period of time. </p>
                         <p>Arcanism can be used to reflect or, though difficult, absorb spells to convert them into pure magical energy. Arcanists can create shields of magical energy, slow down or speed up an object or person’s movement, amplify the effects of spells and magic in general, and teleport distances. However, the act of teleportation is tricky, and those who can teleport typically find that, although their own conception of time is brief, once they arrive at their destination time will have progressed for as long as the teleported distance would have taken on foot.  </p>
                         <p>Arcanists are constantly unravelling the universe’s arcane mysteries, and as such Arcanism is one of the most progressive and world-changing schools. As the understanding of the arcane grows, so too does Arcanism to the point where it is only becoming more powerful. Even so, Arcanism is considerably dangerous and is to be looked at as an unstable school.</p>

                         <p>Nature Magic is the art of controlling natural energies, often in the form of animal empathy, alteration of weather and plant-life, and general druidism. Nature magic allows the wielder to communicate with the natural world and land, thus it is mainly practiced by shamans and druids. Through communion with nature itself, the caster asks the natural spirits for power, and, if granted, is then allowed to control the aspects of nature. This includes giving the caster the power to heal wounds and rejuvenate an individual’s energy. </p>
                         <p>Nature Magic largely depends on an individual’s connection to the natural world and the natural energies that surround it. As such it is not necessary for the caster to be adept at magic, as long as there is at least some magical energies within the individual’s body, which is the case for most mortals. What seems to be most important is the caster’s respect and sincerity towards nature and the natural spirits, as a lack of any will likely not see the spirits return any favours. By establishing a connection with the natural world, someone adept at Nature Magic can manipulate anything from roots to animals, as long as what they are manipulating has a connection with nature.  </p>
                         <p>Actual manipulating of existing natural vegetation and wildlife is one thing, but the other benefits of Nature Magic involve creating nature-like effects from seemingly nothing. Enhancing one’s own skin to become hardened with rock or bark, or transforming oneself into animals or gaining their strengths and abilities are but a few examples of several benefits. Nature Magic is also used to call upon nature’s wrath in the form of storms, earthquakes and floods. Someone truly blessed by nature can effectively transform a landscape to suit nature’s needs.</p>

                         <p>Alchemy is the art of mixing various components and herbs with magical energy. Though it is not required to use magical energy, it is the best way to obtain favourable results. Alchemy is often used to create potions, medicinal ointments or dusts. Potions, depending on the components used and the process of making them, allow for a wide variety of effects ranging from increased healing processes, reinvigoration, physical and mental enhancements etc. Ointments are mainly used for mending wounds or neutralizing poisons, and dusts are side-products used for further alchemical processing or runes or enchantments. </p>
                         <p>Potions made through Alchemy typically require herbs, solvents and other ingredients, though the necessity for magical energies is not needed. However, infusing potions with magical energies during brewing will increase a potion’s effectiveness and will make it more likely for favourable results to occur. As such while it is not required that one has the gift of magic, it certainly helps for making more complicated and stronger potions and ointments. Stronger potions are usually more costly, though in return the added effects are considerably more powerful. Certain recipes are known to be able to cure even the most fatal poisons and diseases.  </p>
                         <p>Other than creating potions that boost various bodily and mind functions, some concoctions are made specifically to be harmful. Potions of acid, liquid flame and similar are, as one would expect, dangerous to touch and even more so to consume. Thus these potions are often used to be thrown, or to melt through steel and other obstacles. Some potions are made to only “trigger” once they come in contact with a specific element or liquid, and some potions will turn into vapour on impact. Contrary to what many would believe of Alchemy, it is not a simple or safe craft of magic, and should be studied and practiced by those who understand its science.</p>

                         <p>Death Magic is the art of reanimation of deceased bodies and control over undeath. Using such bodies, a caster proficient in Death Magic can infuse these empty husks with magical energies to grant undead life. These creatures are often without a will of their own, and are controlled solely by the caster and his commands. Death Magic is also capable of direct control over souls, which allows casters to utilize a victim’s life energy to drain him of life, to the point where the victim is nothing more but a husk. Using negative energies, a caster can focus beams of negative energy infused with the power of both death and undeath.   </p>
                         <p>Death Magic is first and foremost about manipulating the dead and the energies of death. When raising the dead, they infuse magical energy within an empty husk to animate it and bind it to the caster’s will, or by calling forth an apparition from a mortal spirit. The more powerful the caster, the more undead minions he or she can control. There is no limited timeframe when it comes to controlling the undead, and control can last for as long as the caster wishes, or until the connection between caster and undead is severed. Death Magic can also be used to resurrect the recently deceased, though if the soul is no longer present near the victim’s body, then the resurrected body will have no apparent will of its own, and can thus be controlled by the caster. </p>
                         <p>As a school of magic which controls undeath, it is also very efficient at dealing with undeath. Most undead creatures can be destroyed or taken control over by Death Magic. There are also many spells that induce pain and act to drain a target of his or her energies, cause rotting, cast curses or simply kill. In its purest essence and by the judgment of its name, Death Magic is the art of controlling the powers of death itself. A caster can also extend his or her own life by, in the most common term, cheating death. Constantly staving off death should come at relative ease for someone with the necessary and extensive knowledge and skill in how to do it, though few in history have been known to succeed in doing so.</p>

                         <p>Light Magic is the art of using the power of light; most commonly by drawing energy from sunlight or moonlight. A skilled wielder of Light Magic can focus the energies to strengthen it, alter its properties and create new sources of light; though typically Light Magic requires an actual light source to be functional. Light Magic is generally useful for causing extreme burns, blinding of foes, dazing, or even for dispelling. Light Magic can remove the effects of curses, depending on the skills of the caster and the power of the curse in question. It also serves as an excellent counter to Shadow Magic. </p>
                         <p>Light Magic is known to allow for healing, though not for mending wounds. Light can be used, if focused correctly, to purge a body of various ailments, in particular ailments that pertain to curses, but also negative effects such as nausea and blindness, and it is also able to soothe pain. While Light Magic can remove blindness, it can also cause brief blindness, and it can be focused to the point where the heat of light can scorch or melt most surfaces through a condensed beam of light. As such Light Magic is not necessarily only used for good, and holds the potential to cause serious injuries to targets. Even so, it is in a general sense considerably weaker than other schools when it comes to causing harm.   </p>
                         <p>The strongest aspect of Light Magic is its ability to dispel and purge other magic. While it is strongest against Shadow Magic, the school is also quite potent when dispelling against most other magical schools. For instance, Light Magic is quite effective against Illusions, allowing a wielder of Light Magic to dissipate most illusions. Most spellcasters utilize Light Magic to battle against foes that revel in darkness, or to revitalize areas that have been cursed or corrupted. The most skilled casters can use Light to project imagery similar to illusions, or even gain brief precognition. The latter is considerably difficult to master, though if done correctly it is possible for a Light wielder to predict events that are about to occur from within a few minutes to potentially a few hours. Notably, Light Magic is known to attract the attention of Celestials, which isn't always a good thing, as they have a tendency to (much like demons) possess bodies.</p>

                         <p>Elementalism is the art of utilizing the elemental energies that surround the world and the Elemental Plane. Elementalists can materialize elemental energies from the surrounding area into condensed magical energy, converting that energy into more focused elemental properties such as flames, ice or wind. If there is a nearby flame from, say, a torch or a pocket of water in a glass or pond, then the Elementalist can either draw even more elemental energy from these sources, or bend and shape these sources to expand or lash out against their targets. This school of magic holds a lot of potential to cause harm, though some spells can be used to protect or, indeed, heal injuries and some ailments. </p>
                         <p>Elementalism is an extremely varied school of magic due to its potential and tendency to tap into all elemental energies that help build and sustain the world. But to most Elementalists there are four main elements they draw powers from: fire, earth, water and air. Fire is mostly focused on causing harm, earth on granting protection, water on rejuvenation and wind on disruption and confusion. Elementalism is the most common magic school, though only a fraction of casters truly learn to master all four main elements. A majority of casters will focus on mastering one or two elements.   </p>
                         <p>While a common school of magic, Elementalism is also considerably unstable and requires more and more concentration, knowledge and skill as a caster’s elemental abilities develop. In return his or her spells grow considerably more powerful, though the danger of losing control is still present and much more likely to occur. Most individuals who discover that they have the gift of magic are subject to first control elemental powers as their hands are suddenly engulfed in fire, or their touch upon a lake causes bolts of electricity to see dead fish rise to the surface. Since Elementalism is the most common of magical schools, it is thus practiced by most spellcasters, even those who are not naturally gifted with magic.</p>

                             <center><h2 style="color: #970001;">Alteration</h2></center>
                         <p>Alteration is the art of changing components and properties of an existing object or entity, often to create a new variant of the object/entity in question. Alteration can also allow its wielder the ability to enhance certain bodily functions, such as enhanced sight, strength, speed and reflexes. Similarly, it can also be used to cause negative effects, such as blindness, muscle weakness and paralysation. In some cases, alteration is used to transform a person into another; more commonly referred to as polymorphism. </p>
                         <p>While it is not possible to create new components entirely, alteration allows one to shift the composition of elements and minerals within an object to change not only its appearance, but also its internal structure. This basically means that one can transform rock into gold, though it should be noted that doing so will only allow for a temporary effect, as alteration magic can’t last for long periods of time. When an object’s components are changed it will, in usually a short time, either turn back to its original state, liquefy or crumble into dust. The after-effects depend on the caster’s level of understanding when using Alteration magic.  </p>
                         <p>After-effects are less so unpredictable or damaging when it comes to interactions with living tissue. Alteration allows for a caster to temporarily expand muscles, enhance sight and hearing, or improve a person’s reflexes. But if one should do it too much within a short timeframe, it is possible that a person’s internal organs will wear out and fail due to the constant stress. Other applications of Alteration include severe paralysation, where it can halt a targeted person’s motor system and lock a body entirely, or appearance alteration, where a caster of considerable skill can change his or her appearance entirely. The latter appears to be the only ability of Alteration which isn’t subject to returning to an original state.</p>

                         <p>Spiritism is the art of utilizing the abilities and gifts of the spirit-realm and the spirits themselves. Spiritism also draws power from souls and allows the caster to manipulate a target's soul; either by twisting it or by retrieving lost memories. Someone adept at Spiritism is able to call upon the aid of spirits; both kind and malevolent ones. This allows the caster the ability to provide spells of healing as well as harm. The actual type of energy depends on the spirit that binds itself with the caster. Spiritism is typically used to summon spirits for aid, summon weapons and armour of spiritual energy, or by channeling or binding a spirit to a body and soul to grant both mind and physical enhancements; though the cost of control often varies and can be difficult to maintain. Spiritism can also cause rifts between planes, though it is something which is not easily done. This school is commonly associated with shamanism and druidism, though not exclusively.  </p>
                         <p>Spiritism is not always used to gain power from spirits, but to simply just commune with them. This is how someone who practices Spiritism can communicate with the spirits of the dead. Actual communication with the natural spirits is more difficult, since they are less likely to respond in such a way. What Spiritualists will more likely be able to do is gain favour with the natural spirits and temporarily gain their abilities. There are hundreds of types of different spirits in the world and universe, so these abilities can be very varied. Anything from creating spiritual shields to spiritual missiles is possible. Some powers can be achieved without spirits, and instead by utilizing spiritual energy, which circulates the natural world and the spirit-realm. </p>
                         <p>Summoned spirits must comply with laws set by the Spiritualist, and the Spiritualist must comply with the laws set by the spirits. It is an agreement more than it is a command, and both sides must work together in compliance. As such it is difficult to force a summoned spirit to do what one says, and instead it acts on gaining favours. Spiritism itself isn’t particularly difficult to learn, but the actual communion and control of spirits is a different matter. Shamans use Spiritism to commune with the natural spirits and the elemental spirits, whilst priests or seers might use Spiritism to commune with the spirits of the dead. Each spirit has its own personality and its own motivations, which further increases the difficulty of achieving desired effects.</p>

                  <p>The Seven Strictures are the rules written and enforced by the Convocation of Mages and the Vindicators. The strictures were written to ensure safer study and practice of magic, so to avoid the possible dangers that magic can cause, as well as ensure that mages act responsibly and lawfully when using magic. In essence, the Strictures are used as guidelines.</p>
                  <p>The rules that apply to the strictures are mandatory in all the governing mage orders that signed the Caldum Treaty, and most of the nations in Arganorh, Ashanor, Aesudarh and Ryumar strictly enforce these rules to all practitioners of magic in their respective realms. However, there are many variations of these strictures, much depending on the continent or nation they exist in. The seven below are the most common and most recognized ones.</p>
                  <p>While a large majority of mages under the governing mage orders follow the Seven Strictures, there are those that have no wish to do so. These mages and mage orders are simply referred to as renegades, witches or wild/chaos mages. The Vindicators, where they hold jurisdiction, are required to hunt down these law defying mages and bring them to justice; often at the end of a sword. Where the Vindicators have no influence of power, it falls upon the local rule of that nation or region to enforce the strictures, depending on whether they follow them or if they have their own set rules regarding magical crimes.</p>

                         <p>Magic must not control, but be controlled. </p>
                         <p>It is necessary to have the strength and knowledge to control the powers of magic; to avoid fatal consequences to not only the wielder, but to the world and those around the wielder, as well as to ensure a minimal connection between the wielder and the corruption of planar beings. </p>

                         <h3><span>2nd</span> Manipulation</h3>
                         <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                         <p>Magic must not be used to manipulate for one's own personal gain and benefit.</p>
                         <p>Interfering with the balance of the world in the form of distorting time, space or the natural order on a large scale is to be considered dangerous not only to the wielder, but those around him or her, as well as to the entire existence of the world itself. Similarly magic is not to be used to control or otherwise immorally enthrall minds of sentient beings.</p>

                         <h3><span>3rd</span> Responsability</h3>
                         <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                         <p>Magic must not be used unwisely or unnecessarily. </p>
                         <p>One must have the wisdom and constraint to wield magic properly. Spells are not to be cast wildly or without proper thought. Doing so may cause dire consequences to both wielder and those around him or her. Just as one would not cut bread with a sword, one must know when magic is not to be used unnecessarily or irresponsibly.</p>

                         <h3><span>4th</span> Corruption</h3>
                         <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                         <p>Magic must not be used to alter soul or being in corruptible ways.</p>
                         <p>Making use of magic that alters a being's soul and life for personal gain is immoral and strictly forbidden. Making use of such magic attracts otherworlders to the wielder and weak minds; potentially corrupting them. Even the strongest of minds will eventually falter against the corruptible sway of demons and celestials.</p>

                         <p>Magic must not control powers beyond death.</p>
                         <p>The unwilling resurrection and enthralling of the long dead, as well as the general control over beings and spirits of undeath is not permitted. Doing so is an affront to all living things and the greatest disrespect to the forces that maintain the afterlife. </p>

                         <h3><span>6th</span> Transgression</h3>
                         <img src="assets/img/statblock horizontal rule.png" style="width: 250px; margin-top: -30px; padding: 0px" />
                         <p>Magic must not be used to defy laws.</p>
                         <p>If any wielder should use his or her magical powers to commit crime or otherwise break laws for personal gain, he or she is to face judgment at the hand of local authorities, and be punished according to the local customs.</p>

                         <h3><span>7th</span> Association</h3>

                         <p>Magic must not be used in connection with the planar or the otherworldly. </p>
                         <p>The summoning and general dabbling with the kinds of demons, celestials and similar beings is strictly forbidden. These creatures have the will to corrupt weak minds and in time will overcome the minds of even the strongest of mages; effectively possessing one's body at the cost of the wielder's soul and mind.</p>

                      <p>To be considered a mage who is legal, and thus able to cast (allowed) spells without fear of persecution, he or she must typically be part of a mage Order or Academy, or, in some cases, be a legal adviser to a member of nobility or royalty. Mage Legality is a promise between mage and society that is most common in civilized areas of the world, such as within the central nations or within major cities. Some nations beyond the central continents do not necessarily hold the same ideas for Mage Legality.</p>
                      <p>A mage's legality lasts for as long as the mage in question doesn't break any vows he may have spoken as part of his initiation, break any of the seven Strictures of Magic, or break the laws set by local authorities. Additionally, if a mage abandons his Order or Academy without consent or permission, he is branded an illegal, or otherwise known to the general public as a renegade mage.</p>

                      <p>Renegade mages are commonly mages who have broken their vows or at least one of the Strictures. Many renegades are also mages who have killed illegally, or otherwise broken local laws. These renegades tend to hide far away from bustling cities and prefer to take their chances in the wilds or within outlying villages. Renegades can be dangerous as they hold no regard for others when it comes to their uses of magic, yet there are also renegades who just simply want to live their life in peace without rules or vows to hold them down. Some renegades also abandon their vows as the result of their uncontrollable magic potential. Their potent magical energies prove to be too much for them to control, and thus they leave and hide somewhere where they can't be of harm to anyone. These mages are simply known as Wild Mages, though they are still technically considered renegades.</p>

                    <p>Some nations have specific groups or orders that deal with the hunting of renegade mages. The most renowned one is the Vindicators; a sub-order of the Convocation of Mages and the Anorian Sacellum. These hunters train in the arts of resisting and countering magic, and thus improve their chances of facing off dangerous illegal mages. While a typical mission involves apprehending the renegade so that he or she may be held for trial, most encounters end up in bloodshed.</p>

                    <p>While legal mages must belong to an Order or Academy, there is a small exception to the rule. Freemages, as they are commonly known, are mages who  do not follow or belong to any order. But unlike renegade mages, Freemages are legally allowed to roam freely, so long as they abide by the given rules of magical restraint and common laws. Freemages generally carry some sort of pendant or piece of paper to prove that they are legal mages. These proofs are generally referred to as "Right of Magic". Such proof is usually obtained through a mage of an order or another, more influential Freemage. Lords of some nations can also provide legal documents. Obtaining legal proof of their Freemage status is not as easy as it sounds, as it sets a premise that expects the mage in question to be able to control, supervise and otherwise maintain his or her promises of legality and magical energies without the aid of a third party. Such promises are a expectancy that is rarely upheld, and thus many would be hesitant to give a mage his or her Freemage papers.</p>

               <h2>Redwain</h2>
               <p>	The Kingdom of Redwain was formerly of the Kynacia province, as part of the Old Imperium in the Time of the Imperium. After the Old Imperium's fall after the Divine Rebellion, in the beginning of the Time of Ages, Kynacia was settled and founded as the Kingdom of Ostmere. Following disputes between the lords of the region, Kynacia was split in half; northern Kynacia remained as Ostmere, while southern Kynacia was claimed and named as the Kingdom of Redwain, and has since always been of Redwani territory.</p>
               <p>In recent years, Redwain has come into a rejuvenated state of conflict with Ostmere. Following what was known as the Norrmark Massacre, where several hundred inhabitants (a majority orcs) and soldiers of both Redwani and Ostmerian origin were slaughtered in a territorial dispute. Ostmere and Redwain have since been preparing for possible aggression from both sides, which would inevitably lead to a new war between the two nations.</p>

             <h2>Northgate</h2>
             <p>	The city is surrounded by three main walls; the Inner Walls, the Outer Walls, and the Outskirts Walls. The Outskirts Walls have mostly been abandoned by the city's military, and have fallen to ruin due to little to no maintenance. These walls instead mark the line for the city's outer houses and structures. Within the Outer Walls, the actual city begins and stands proud. The older buildings remain within the Inner Walls, where the Red Palace stands at the very center island of Targenhold, and the Houses of high society with greater influence over the city remain on the nearby island district of Hightown.</p>
             <p>Though the city is officially ruled by Lord Jorick of House Belevar, the Council of Officials (sometimes also known as the Council of Nobles) maintains the city almost equally. It consists of the most powerful Houses that reside in the city, as well as by some foreign dignitaries who have significant influence in the city. Though despite having what should be a functional and proper governmental rule, much of the city's inhabitants remain poor and in debt. This has helped to further strengthen the image that Northgate is a city of corruption and mistreatment. Most of the city's Watchmen allow themselves to bribery and indulge in criminal behaviour, which is often to the benefit of the actual criminal organization who reside in the city; such as the Underthieves and the Brownhoods, who, from the shadows, run rampant throughout the city, despite the City Watch's best efforts to contain them.</p>

           <h2>The Imperium</h2>
           <p>	The current Imperium is the reincarnation of its former self; back when the Old Imperium held power over almost the entire continent of Avanor. It was the first human nation in Avanor, having been founded a few centuries after the fall of the elven Sun Kingdoms during the Time of Suns, at the hands of the human tribes and orcish clans. The Old  Imperium grew strong and expanded with  ruthless intent; all in the service to the Golden  Pantheon, the human gods that  watched over them at the time. But after Andarien's rise to power, and her Divine Rebellion, the old Imperium was doomed to fall, and in its ashes were reborn the New Imperium; today simply referred to as the Imperium, or the Darion Imperium.</p>
           <p>The Imperium consists of three provinces; Avinter in the north, Darion in the south, and Danthivia in the east. Each of these provinces offer a variety of benefits to the Imperium as a whole. Avinter's past as a seafaring nation, in the ages when it was independent, has given the Imperium capable fleets and power on the seas. Danthivia, with its many hills and plains, feeds the Imperium thanks to its rich agricultural lands, and its southern coastal cities serve well as trade hubs with the cities of the Ryumar continent. Darion, as the homeland to the true Imperials, grants the Imperium the might of the people, with its densely populated lands, and the wealth of its southern mines.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div class="mu-about-us-left"> 
            <p> There is a religious and scientific belief/theory that the world is divided into three rings. However, mages all around generally agree that this is more a fact than it is a theory, and priests of various deities have preached the world's cosmology for centuries. There are several different versions or beliefs as to how the known universe is built and put together, though the map (up) is the most commonly known and accepted representation; as determined by several high standing priests and mages both.</p>
            <p> The outer ring consists of the High Halls, where the gods reside. The ring beneath the High Halls is known as the Divide; a protective shell and realm of magic weaved long ago by the gods to prevent mortals from reaching the High Halls. Due to its instability built up over the last few thousands of years, it also functions as a crossroad which other worlds might use to travel to Tariel, and thus the other way around as well, though it is seemingly a rare occurrence. Past the Divide, closer to the center, lies the Veil. The Veil is technically part of the Divide, but it sustains a weaker form, making it ideal for Otherworlders and Planeborn to intrude through.</p>
            <p> The Divide is also where Celunar and Lucine travel; the sister moons. They circle Tariel as if chasing each other, and while only one moon is ever present on the night sky at any one time, and while they are not so easily distinguishable from one another, it is known that Celunar and Lucine seem to, as it were, take turns on when they show.</p>
            <p> Surrounding all of the cosmos is Sol, commonly referred to as the sun. According to some religious texts, Sol is either a greater entity whose power exceeds that of the Creators, or it is the deceased Creator Sol, whose light has engulfed the universe around her. Only theories surround the nature of Sol.</p>

        <p> In reference to the Veil, Mages have long used the Veil for various experiments; often dangerous ones, where they create hidden sanctuaries for themselves in the Veil. But the Veil would most apparently seem to draw the attention of spirits; particularly so of the deceased. Spirits of the dead flock to the Veil, where they await their benefactors or wander endlessly in grief and confusion. The practice of Veil Sanctuaries have since the fall of the Old Imperium decreased significantly, and most Mage Orders outlaw it. Those who venture into the Veil sometimes come across abandoned Sanctuaries, most of which have been abandoned since the days of the Old Imperium.</p>
        <p> The inner circle is the Mortal Realm, where, as the name implies, mortals reside. This is the centre of Tariel, where the gods draw most of their power from, and where all energies of the surrounding universe converges to sustain the world's balance. Past these rings lies the Dark Beyond; presumably the rest of the universe, which is also commonly referred to as the Otherworlds. Eight other planets are known to reside in close vicinity to Tariel, though astronomers agree that there are likely more. These Otherworlds are very similar to Tariel in their own rights.</p>
        <p> The circles that lie between the Divide and the Mortal Realm are representations of planes or worlds that have either intruded upon Tariel or always existed beside it; having over the many ages become far more accessible to Tarielborn, Planeborn and Otherworlders as the understanding of magic grew. These planes are simply known as the Planeworlds, and while there are currently eight represented planes, experts agree that there are likely many more planes waiting to be discovered.</p>
        <p> Additional realms exist within the Mortal Realm itself. Although it is dwarf-made, the Underhalls is generally considered a realm of its own. The Underneaths are just below the Underhalls, where several former Dalh Shavai cities reside and other mostly unknown terrors. Below the Underneaths lies the Underdepths, which is almost completely unexplored and few surfacers have ever gone there. At the very center of the Mortal Realm is the World Core, where the prisons of past Primordial Titans and the fallen Creator turned Archon, Gaerdras, reside; watched over by Black Dragons.</p>

                 <p>Ninguem sabe ao certo quando elas surgiram ou o porque. As Rift Stones estão distribuídas por todo o território de Tariel. Ao tocar em uma Rift Stone, individuos que conseguem manipular a mana (muitas vezes chamados simplesmente por aventureiros) são teletrasportados para um demiplano chamado Hall of Heroes.</p>
                 <p>Nesse lugar varios hérois de mundos diferentes e distantes se organizam para grandes aventuras. Um aventureiro poderá contratar ajuda dos heróis ali presentes, criando um link e relacionamento entre host e pawn. Os heróis poderão então entrar no mundo do host através da Rift Stones criando um avatar do mesmo.</p>
                 <p> Não é incomum o encontro de heróis nativos do próprio mundo, para eles o conhecimento obtido através dos contratos são inastimáveis, e uma boa forma de ignorar a distância entre as regiões dos continentes.</p>
                 <p> Muitos acreditam que o responsável pelas Rift Stones seja o próprio Kruphix, o deus dos horizontes. Acredita-se que O Mediador, escriba que cuida dos pagamentos e contratos seja um agente direto dele, ou até mesmo um avatar do próprio deus. </p>
                   <p>Abaixo segue as características mecanicas do sistema de pawns:</p>                              
                     <ul>
                      <li>Um host não consegue criar um vínculo de contrato com um herói acima de 3 leveis de diferença.</li>
                      <li>A experiência dos encontros são divididas por igual entre host e pawns. Um pawn pode evoluir caso participe de vários contratos.</li>
                      <li>Se o contrato for bem sucedido, o pawn adquiri todo o conhecimento obtido durante a aventura, trazendo de volta a lore aprendida.</li>
                      <li>Quando um pawn morre durante um contrato, seu avatar é destruido após 1 minuto, não deixando nada para trás. Ele tambem perde toda a memória dos eventos ocorridos durante o período do contrato.</li>                    
                      
                    </ul>

                      <li>Cada pawn tem sua própria personalidade, podendo haver conflitos de interesse nas missões. Eles possuem livre arbitrio em tomada de decições. Caso o objetivo da aventura mude drasticamente, eles podem romper o contrato. Caso o motivo seja por informações falsas por parte do host, o mesmo perde o dinheiro do contrato, caso seja por motivos externos, o host recebe de volta 50% do valor contratado como crédito.</li>
                      <li>Alguns pawns podem inserir um termo de divisão de espólios no contrato. Outros estão satisfeitos somente com o conhecimento objetido.</li>
                      <li>Um jogador pode se registrar como pawn entre aventuras. Nesse período o mesmo pode ser contratado por outros jogadores.</li>
                      <li>O preço de um contrato é calculado da seguinte forma: soma para cada pawn <b>valor base * level²</b>, e o resultado é multiplicado pela quantidade de pawns. Fórmula: <b>[S(base*lvl²)]*qtd</b>.</li>
                      <li>Alem do preço do contrato, o host precisa pagar a taxa da diária: (5gp * level) por dia por pawn.</li>
                      <li>O host precisa cobrir o custo de componentes materiais consumíveis de pawns spellcasters.</li>
